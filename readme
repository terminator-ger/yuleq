Yuleq, short for yuâ€™egh leQ, is a tool for comparing audio files.


Use
---
Run from terminal

    yuleq item1.wav item2.wav item3.wav

The test items are played in a continous loop. You can switch between the items and adjust the loop. Requires ffmpeg.

To get a useful result, the test items should have common properties:
 - same delay
 - same loudness
 - same length (warning is shown)
 - same number of channels (enforced)
 - same sampling rate (enforced)

Use the -b option to run a blind test with shuffled test items. The -r option does the same, but keeps the first item in place as reference.

Nearly all common codecs are supported through ffmpeg. If you get a "command failed" error, ffprobe or ffmpeg might be missing from $PATH. Run with -v option for more details.

Some operating systems or use a low-quality resampler. For example, there appears to be a bug in pulseaudio where the resampler occasionally produces a terrible clinking sound. The -r option mitigates this problem by using the high-quality ffmpeg resampler. The output rate should match that of the audio device.

Build
-----
Portaudio must be installed and linkable.

Linux, BSD, OSX

    gcc -O2 -lportaudio -lm yuleq.c -o yuleq

Windows is supported, but I can't give you a simple one-liner. Sorry.

Qapla'!
